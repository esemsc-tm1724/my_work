## Portfolio containing some of of the course-work I have produced during my masters. 

Deep Learning: In this code I worked with a dataset of corrupted brain scan images and trained a neural network to impute the missing data from the images.

Data Science and Machine Learning: In part 1 of this coursework I was tasked with preprocessing some ocean data and testing a range of machine learning models and tuning their hyperparameters to decide the best model for that specific dataset. In part 2 of this coursework we were given a preprocessed dataset to use to test and compare some classificaiton models.

Computational Mathematics: This coursework saw me implementing various numerical methods in code. In part 2 I implemented and tested different methods of interpolation and numerical integration. Part 3 saw me implement code to solve an ODE numerically.
