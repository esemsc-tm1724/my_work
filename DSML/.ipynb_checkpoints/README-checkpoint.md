# Welcome to your assessment!

This assignment contains two questions focused on different machine learning tasks: one regression problem and one classification problem. Each question has specific requirements and evaluation criteria, so please read the instructions carefully.

## üìÑ Instructions

### Submission Requirements
- You should submit only two notebooks: `Q1_answer.ipynb` and `Q2_answer.ipynb`.
- Any extra files, scripts, or notebooks in your repository will not be considered for marking.
- Ensure that each notebook is clearly structured with your code, explanations, and final conclusions.
- The assessments are run as open-book assessments, and as such we have worked hard to create a coursework that assesses synthesis of knowledge rather than factual recall. Be aware that access to the internet,
notes or other sources of factual information in the time provided may not be too helpful and may well limit your time to successfully synthesise the answers required.
- You can only use python modules exist in `dsml` environment.

## ü§î Plagiarism
**This is an individual assessment**

The use of the work of another student,
past or present, constitutes plagiarism. Giving your work to another student to use  also constitute
an offence. Collusion is a form of plagiarism and will be treated in a similar manner. This is an **individual
assessment** and thus should be completed solely by you. The College will investigate all instances where
an assessment offence is reported or suspected, using plagiarism software, vivas and other tools, and apply
appropriate penalties to students. 

## üîç Disclosing the use of external sources

We provide you with a `references.md` file in your repo. Update this file with any books, websites or AI tools you use to help you in writing this code. For tutorial sites, the main URL or landing page you used will suffice. For Q&A sites (e.g. Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange), or when interacting with ChatGPT please link the specific question/response which helped you. ***Failing to disclose a used external source will be considered plagiarism***.

## üß™ Question Breakdown

### Q1: Predicting Significant Wave Heights (Regression Problem) - 70 Marks
**Description**: In this task, you‚Äôll be predicting significant wave heights based on environmental and oceanic conditions. This is a regression problem and requires a structured approach, including preprocessing, modeling, and model selection and evaluation.

- **Total Marks**: 70 out of 100
- **Breakdown**: You can find a detailed breakdown of the 70 marks in the `Q1.ipynb` notebook.
- **Requirements**:
  - Implement data preprocessing based on EDA insights.
  - Apply feature engineering where beneficial.
  - Conduct model selection and tuning.
  - Evaluate the model thoroughly with performance metrics.
  - **Documentation**: Each decision in your code should be briefly explained with a less-than-one-line markdown comment.
  - **Final Summary**: Write a paragraph at the end of `Q1_answer.ipynb` summarizing your choices, rationale, and evidence-based decisions.

### Q2: Predicting Passenger Transportation (Classification Problem) - 30 Marks
**Description**: This task involves predicting whether passengers were transported based on personal and travel-related data. This is a classification problem focused on model selection, tuning, and error analysis.

- **Total Marks**: 30 out of 100
- **Requirements**:
  - Perform model selection and tuning.
  - Use metrics such as AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall to assess models.
  - Analyze and adjust thresholds based on error costs in different scenarios.
  - **Documentation**: Each key decision should be accompanied by a markdown comment explaining what you‚Äôre doing.
  - **Final Summary**: Write a paragraph at the end of `Q2_answer.ipynb` summarizing your final model choices and the rationale behind them.

## üí° Important Notes
- Each notebook should contain code that shows your decision-making process clearly, with concise markdown comments explaining each step.
- At the end of each question, provide a summary paragraph explaining your choices and rationale.
- Only `Q1_answer.ipynb` and `Q2_answer.ipynb` will be reviewed. Ensure that all work for each question is contained within these two notebooks.
